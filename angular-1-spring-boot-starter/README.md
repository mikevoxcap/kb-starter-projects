# angular-1-spring-boot-starter

This is a starter application that is based on a client project. The original project was generated by using Yeoman for the Angular 1 + Gulp code base and start.spring.io for the Spring Boot code base. Then, the UI related code was merged into the Spring Boot project and customizations were made to make the two work together as a UI Microservice project.
